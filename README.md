Commit Formatter (In Production)
===============

A small web-based utility that allows to format commits comments according to Intermedia standards.
This project is a part of my JavaScript-learning Sandbox. It's an example of pure JavaScript application based on AMD (require.js) and MVVM (knockout.js) patterns.
